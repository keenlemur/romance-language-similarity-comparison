# romance-language-similarity-comparison

1. About

This is a tool to compare similarity of sentences in Romance languages using Jaccard similarity.

Note that Jaccard similarity for language comparison is less accurate than dedicated Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools.

Romance languages are languages that descend from Latin. In this case, the Romance languages used are:

    Italian (IT)
    Portuguese (PT)
    Spanish (ES)
    Catalan (CA)
    French (FR)

2. How to Use

Navigate to Section 2. INITIAL LANGUAGE SENTENCES (lines 19-25 in the code) and enter your sentences.

The output will display:

    Your sentences
    Sentence comparisons from most to least similar
    Mean score of the comparisons
    Value most similar to the mean of the comparisons
